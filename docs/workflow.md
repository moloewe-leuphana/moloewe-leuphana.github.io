# MoLöwe Workflow

Preparing a workshop with the MoLöwe requires certain **steps** presented and explained in the following workflow.

## <Highlight> 1 Request a User Account </Highlight>

You're going to build your MoLöwe project in the **MoLöwe software** (browser based i.e. no local installation needed),
which you can use remotely from your office, home, anywhere.
Accessing the MoLöwe software requires a user account (name and password).

User accounts are limited to researchers and student courses at Leuphana.
Please send a request for a user account to **moloewe@leuphana.de** and state your research project or course.
User accounts for workshop participants will be provided the day of the workshop session.

You will also receive a user account for the **MoLöwe campus site** and an account for **JupyterHub**.
For information on how to use MoLöwe on campus, see chapters "Local vs. Server version" and "Working on Campus" of the MoLöwe Booklet.

While you wait for your user accounts, please read chapter [**Data Input & Output**](input_output.md).

## <Highlight> 2 Explore the User Interface </Highlight>

Once you received your username and password, you can access the MoLöwe software [**here**](https://moloewe.leuphana.de/login).
The software is accessible through any browser, but use **Mozilla Firefox** for optimal results.

Please familiarize yourself with the user interface of MoLöwe with the help of the [**User Interface Chapter**](user-interface.md).

:::info
There is no need to fully understand all subpages of the Edit Mode yet. They will be explained in the course of this workflow.

## <Highlight> 3 Create a Project and Explore Tools</Highlight>

Now, please create a MoLöwe project according to the [**Projects Page**](docs/edit-mode/01_projects.md).

Before you start adding slides to your project, you need to plan which [**tools**](glossary.md#tools) you want to use.
Please visit the [**Tools Chapter**](docs/moloewe-tools/00_overview.md) to explore the available MoLöwe tools.

:::info
In the tools chapter, please note if the tools you want to use need to be set up in the
[**Project Notebook**](glossary.md#project-notebook).
This will determine if the following step will be relevant for you.

## <Highlight> 4 Set Up Tools in the Project Notebook </Highlight>

This step is relevant for you, if the tools you want to use need to be set up in the Project Notebook.

**About User privileges**

User privileges can be assigned to one or several MoLöwe projects and modes. User privileges can be given for Presentation Mode 
(advisable for workshop participants) or Edit Mode.<br />
Each MoLöwe project will belong to one user group and have one user as the owner/author.
The user group will be set during the creation of a project and can be changed by the user group administrator.
For each user account privileges may be given to certain functionalities in Edit Mode (e.g. import/export, creating new projects).
- "MoLöwe" is short for "Mobile Lösungswerkstatt" (eng. "Mobile Solution Workshop")
- see [Glossary](glossary.md)
- Software to create and run interactive browser based dashboard.
- Based on open standard frameworks (_plotly, Echarts, mapbox_).
- With control elements for interactive data visualisation (button, switch, dropdown, slider).
- User programs interactive content and tools in _jupyter notebook_ ( _Python_ language).
- Content that is not interactive (video, image, slideshow, textbox) can be added via the MoLöwe Software directly
(not programmed in  _jupyter notebook_ ).
- Users upload their _jupyter notebook_ based on the jupyter notebook template for their project.
- Users upload files, like images, videos, text and data for their project.
- MoLöwe Software runs with any browser, but use Mozilla Firefox for optimal results.
- The MoLöwe Software runs on the moloewe.leuphana.de server (remote access), as well as on the local machine at Leuphana.
- The MoLöwe application on the server and the local machine are two separate systems with separate user account management.
- To get started (see Getting Started) you need a user account. 
- The local machine is connected to five 65’’ screens, which is the basic set-up for a workshop setting.
- The five 65’’ screens offer workshop participants an immersive experience.
- Workshop participants can interact with the content on the big screens via tablets.
- The following documentation will guide you through the application step by step.
