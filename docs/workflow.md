## <Highlight> 1 Request a User Account </Highlight>

You're going to build your MoLöwe project in the **MoLöwe software** (browser based i.e. no local installation needed),
which you can use remotely from your office, home, anywhere.
Accessing the MoLöwe software requires a user account (name and password).

User accounts are limited to researchers and student courses at Leuphana.
Please send a request for a user account to **moloewe@leuphana.de** and state your research project or course.
User accounts for workshop participants will be provided the day of the workshop session.

You will also receive a user account for the **MoLöwe campus site** and an account for **JupyterHub**.
For information on how to use MoLöwe on campus, see chapters "Local vs. Server version" and "Working on Campus" of the MoLöwe Booklet.

While you wait for your user accounts, please read chapter [**Data Input & Output**](input_output.md).

## <Highlight> 2 Explore the User Interface </Highlight>

Once you received your username and password, you can access the MoLöwe software [**here**](https://moloewe.leuphana.de/login).
The software is accessible through any browser, but use **Mozilla Firefox** for optimal results.

Please familiarize yourself with the user interface of MoLöwe with the help of the [**User Interface Chapter**](user-interface.md).

Please visit the [**Tools Chapter**](docs/moloewe-tools/00_overview.md) to explore the available MoLöwe tools.

In the tools chapter, please note if the tools you want to use need to be set up in the
