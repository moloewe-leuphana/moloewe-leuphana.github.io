# Image

An Image Tool is used to display an image during a presentation.

The Image Tool does not require definition of a function on the Project Notebook.

## **Uploading Images to MoLöwe**

The images that need to be placed on a slide can be uploaded from the Front-End with the [**process described here**](docs/02-the-interface/04_files.md#2-upload-a-new-file).

## **Placing Image on a Slide (Edit Mode)**

To place a Image Tool on a Slide, first upload the image to MoLöwe. Then, open the slide in which the Image Tool needs to be placed in Edit Mode.

Then, open the tool selection panel in Edit Mode on the page that you want to place the tool in by following steps outlined [**here**](docs/02-the-interface/05_slides.md#4-editing-slides-edit-mode).

Following that, click on the Image icon.

![](/img/doc/66_image.jpg)

This will place a container for the Image Tool onto the slide.

When a user hovers over this container, they will be presented with a gear icon that they can click on.

Clicking on this icon opens an interface that allows users to select the Image that they want to add to the slide.

The required fields in this interface are **Tool Name** and **Select Image**. The *Tool Name* is a unique identifier for the tool, whereas the *Select Image* is a list of images that the users can select from. The Header and Footer text are optional.

Once the tool name has been defined and an image has been selected, users are taken back to the slide in Edit Mode.

Following this, the user can [**resize**](00_overview.md#resize-a-tool) or [**reposition**](00_overview.md#reposition-a-tool) the tool as they desire.

Do note that when the slide is in Edit Mode, a rectangular box appears around the tool. This box does not appear around the tool when the slide is viewed in Presentation or Controller Modes.

## **Viewing an Image during Presentation**

During presentation (i.e. while at Presentation Mode or Controller Mode), users can view the Image tool that was defined in the Edit Mode using the steps described above.
