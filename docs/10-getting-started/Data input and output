# Data input and output
Before starting to work with the MoLöwe software or hardware researchers have already generated content that serves as input data for the workshop. This data depends on the specific research project and can be any type of system knowledge that can take many forms. For example, input data can be in the form of numbers, ratings, scenarios, maps, pictures, text or videos. Next researchers have to address what happens with this data during the workshop, how it should be visualised and thus how the data output could look like. Let us take the case of creating a greener urban space. To this end, researchers have captured the status quo of a city district in a map. The map contains information on the location, size and type of green spaces in this district (trees, private lawns, parks …). Furthermore the map contains information on buildings with roofs and facades suitable for planting green infrastructure. In this hypothetical project researchers have also gathered data on the costs and benefits for increasing the green infrastructure based on three different scenarios. This data is visualised for the workshop in forms of maps, graphs and augmented pictures. Workshop participants are city planners and residents that can choose different types and amount of green infrastructure for their district, will see the effect their choice has on costs and benefits and experience the future district in forms of augmented pictures. Therefore, abstract findings become tangible which in turn fosters discussions and debates. During the researchers want to capture which barriers hinder implementation of a greener urban spaces. This output data can be collected in the form of ratings and surveys.
