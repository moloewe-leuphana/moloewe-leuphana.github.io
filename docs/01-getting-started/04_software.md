# Software

The software for this **interactive browser based dashboard** was **custom developed** for the Mobile Solution Workshop. Backend and fronted development are based on expandable frameworks with open standards. For example, for interactive graphs the software uses plotly and Echarts, providers of online data analytics and visualisation tools, and for interactive maps mapbox, a provider for custom online maps. To control these interactive data visualisation control elements, such as switches and dropdown lists, were developed for the Mobile Solution Workshop.
The software is accessible through any browser, but use **Mozilla Firefox** for optimal results.
