# ðŸ“ˆ House Data Visualization

Prerequisite: You need to install our `moloewe_chart` package from `moloewe_chart.zip`.

To do this:

- Open a terminal in the directory which contains `moloewe_chart.zip`
- Activate your current working virtual environment
- Install the package using the command `pip install --user moloewe_chart.zip`

For this example, we will be working with `house-prices.csv` dataset. Let's check it out.

```python
import pandas as pd
local_path = 'D:/codes/leuphana-work/molowe/data/'
house_data = pd.read_csv(local_path + "house-prices.csv")
house_data.head()
```

## **1 Coming up with concept (separately from MoLÃ¶we notebook)**

In this example, we would like to visualize the relationship between the house prices vs lot sizes and use color to indicate the number of garages a particular house has.

This part we can build independently outside the MoLÃ¶we notebook, and later we can copy the codes back to the notebook and modify some places.

### Determine the static part of the plot

This would be the static part of the plot, i.e. the part that stay the same and is not affected by the dropdown list. You can comfortably create a graph like below

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Because the number of garage in the data is continuous, we convert it to discreet
# for the plot
house_data["garage"] = house_data["garage"].astype(str)

# Create the scatter plot
f = px.scatter(house_data, x = "lotsize", y = "price", 
                color = "garage", 
                title="House Prices vs Lot Size in the City of Windsor, Canada")

# Change the axis labels
f.update_layout(xaxis_title = "Lot Size (sqm)",
                yaxis_title = "Price ($)")

# we define chart configuration settings for Plotly (Plotly offers a config parameter)
    # in this case we try to set the ModeBar to inactive (not all options are available for Plotly in Python when exporting)
```

![](/img/doc/house_data_prices_vs_lot_size.jpg)

### Determine the "interactive" part of the plot
From the above plot, we now want to dive deeper and visualize the relationship between the house prices vs lot sizes **with a FILTER - the different numbers of bedrooms**. Therefore, the information about the numbers of bedrooms is now our moving part of the plot, and is flowing into the dropdown list we are now building. I try breaking it down into the following steps:

#### 1. Get one possible value for your dropdown list as a placeholder and build an initial plot
We need a starting point to build a plot. Therefore, it is advisable to use one possible value of the dropdown list and combine it with the static part to create your first plot. This would be the skeleton to your final plot when you combine it with the information from the dropdown list.

```python
house_data["bedrooms"].unique()

array([3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 6], dtype=int64)
```
After looking at the unique values for bedroom number, I just choose a value, here I chose 2 as a placeholder. Now I build the "skeleton":

```python
import plotly.express as px

house_data = pd.read_csv("data/house-prices.csv")

# Now we can subset houses which have 2 bedrooms
df_bedroom = house_data[house_data["bedrooms"] == 2]

# Because the number of garage in the data is continuous, we convert it to discreet for the plot
df_bedroom["garage"] = df_bedroom["garage"].astype(str)

# Create the scatter plot (with adjusted title)
f = px.scatter(df_bedroom, x = "lotsize", y = "price", 
                color = "garage",
                title="House Prices vs Lot Size in the City of Windsor, Canada - " + str(2) + " bedroom(s)")

# Change the axis labels
f.update_layout(xaxis_title = "Lot Size (sqm)",
                yaxis_title = "Price ($)")

# we define chart configuration settings for Plotly (Plotly offers a config parameter)
    # in this case we try to set the ModeBar to inactive (not all options are available for Plotly in Python when exporting
```

![](/img/doc/house_data_prices_vs_lot_size_two_bedrooms.jpg)

Now what you are seeing is a "version" of your interactive plot, that is the plot you would get when you select the value 2 from the dropdown list.

This is also a good time for you to fine-tuning your plot, adding titles and labels, checking the size, working the legend, etc. anything and involves the static part of your plot.

#### 2. Get all possible values for your dropdown list

Now that we have the "skeleton" of your interactive plot in place, let's make the dropdown happen.

First, we need to check out all the possible values to be displayed in the dropdown list under a variable. Here, we extract all the unique values of the column bedrooms, and warp it in a list comprehension to produce a python list. We also sort the list, so the output would make more sense when being incorporated into the dropdown list.

```python
# Get all possible values your dropdown list
bedroom_number = [i for i in house_data["bedrooms"].unique()]
bedroom_number.sort()
print(bedroom_number)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

And this is all you need to prepare before modifying the dropdown list function in the MoLÃ¶we notebook.

## **2 Working in the MoLÃ¶we notebook**

Now we write code that is actually going into the MoLÃ¶we notebook.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: in order for things to run in MoLÃ¶we, everything has to warped inside a function.

The following cells are essential codes for MoLÃ¶we to function, they must be included everytime we write a MoLÃ¶we notebook. They are included in the notebook template. We can leave most of them as is.

:::tip
What we should change, for example, is the `mapbox_access_token`. For a project working with MoLÃ¶we using map data, one can obtain this by signing up on Openstreetmap and get one's own API Token.

```

#### Definition of tools for global use
In this section you can define the interactive tools if they are used repeatedly throughout the presentation.

##### Tool Switch
Here you can define the class `tool_switch`.
For this tool work, you need a `set_` and a `get_` function for each switch button. You can find examples in MoLÃ¶we documentation.
```python
class tool_switch:

    pass 
```

##### Tool Dropdown
Here you can define the class `tool_dropdown`.
For this tool work, you need a `set_` and a `get_` function for each dropdown list. You can find examples in MoLÃ¶we documentation.
```python
class tool_dropdown:

    pass
```

##### Tool Button
Here you can define the class `tool_button`.
For this tool work, you only need a `set_` function for each button. You can find examples in MoLÃ¶we documentation.
```python
class tool_button:

    pass
```

##### Tool Slider
Here you can define the class `tool_slider`.
For this tool work, you need a `set_` and `get_` function for each slider. You can find examples in MoLÃ¶we documentation.
```python
class tool_slider:

    pass
```

##### Tool Map
Here you can define the class `tool_map`.
For this tool work, you need a `get_` function for each button. You can find examples in MoLÃ¶we documentation.
```python
class tool_map:

    pass
```

##### Tool Graph
Here you can define the class `tool_graph`.
For this tool work, you need a `get_` function for each graph/plot. You can find examples in MoLÃ¶we documentation.
```python
class tool_graph:

    pass
```

### Create functions and global variables

There are different tools and interactive objects in MoLÃ¶we, each is define as a Class. For this example we only need two things: an instance from Class `tool_dropdown` (for our dropdown list) and an instance from `tool_graph` (to display the plot).
Let's start by setting up our bedroom number dropdown.

#### Create a global variable

The first step is to create two global variables, one contains all possible values for a dropdown, and one contains the selected values. The selected value we set now in this initialization phase will be the default value for the plot. For now, we just copy the values we saw before and feed it in the `bedroom_number_all` variable. (Sidenote: we can actually make these variable dynamic by loading them directly from the data, but that adds another layer of explanation, so for now I just do this manually. Once you get the logic of MoLÃ¶we, it would be easier to then try this alternative out).

```python
# Get all possible values your dropdown list
global bedroom_number_all
bedroom_number_all = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Set global variables with default
global bedroom_number_selected
bedroom_number_selected = 1
```

#### Setting up functions for a dropdown in `tool_dropdown`

For one instance of a dropdown, we have to write two functions: a `get_` and a `set_` function

- `get_` function sets up and initializes the dropdown values
- `set_` function runs in the background everytime we interact with the dropdown list in presentation mode and choose a value, so that value can in turn be used in e.g. plotting.

- These functions must be appended to the class `tool_dropdown` using `setattr()`.

Now onto our example, we would set up a `get_bedroom_number` function to initialize the dropdown list. It needs two things: 
- (1) all of the possible values we want to choose from
- (2) the default value, i.e. which value is displayed in the dropdown and also fed to the plot the moment we start the presentation

```python
# Define get function
def get_bedroom_number(self): # here you put the function name
    return {
        "values": bedroom_number_all, # all the possible values (saved in bedroom_number)
        "default": bedroom_number_selected, # the default value (saved in bedroom_number_selected)
    }

# Append the function to class tool_dropdown
setattr(tool_dropdown, "get_bedroom_number", get_bedroom_number)
```

Now we set up the function `set_bedroom_number`. This function allows you to change the variable `bedroom_number_selected` based on what you are selecting in the dropdown (`dropdown_selection`). There is nothing much to modifying here, just name the function and call the right global variable:

```python
# Define set function
def set_bedroom_number(self, dropdown_selection):  # here you put the function name
    global bedroom_number_selected # here you call the global variable
    bedroom_number_selected = dropdown_selection # assign the variable as the selected dropdown content

# Append the function to class tool_dropdown
setattr(tool_dropdown, "set_bedroom_number", set_bedroom_number)
```

#### Modify the plot code and put it into `tool_graph`

After creating our interactive part - the dropdown list - we now incorporate this into our static plot to obtain our plotting function in class `tool_graph`.

Regarding the class `tool_graph`, we only need to build one function for each of the plot created. Here I will create function `get_houseprice_chart`

Essentially, we copy the "skeleton" code we created before here, and where placeholder (2) was, we replace it with the variable `bedroom_number_selected`. There are some other things that just need to be there as MoLÃ¶we structure:

- Load MoLÃ¶we package with `from moloewe_chart import MoloeweChart`
- Initialize instance of MoloeweChart with `my_chart = MoloeweChart()`
- Get the directory to the asset folder `data` on the server and load our dataset from there
- Add plot to this instance using the method `moloewe_chart_plot` and return it in the end 

Basically in the example below, `my_chart` receives plotting information as a dictionary from the plot `f` (`f` is an instance of Ploty Express)

```python
def get_houseprice_chart(self):

    # Load MoLÃ¶we package
    from moloewe_chart import MoloeweChart

    # Load othe necessary packages (here Plotly Express)
    import plotly.express as px

    # Initialize instance of MoloeweChart
    my_chart = MoloeweChart()

    # We call the selected variable (passed from the dropdown)
    global bedroom_number_selected

    # Load data (this global variable data contains the directory to our asset folder "data" on the server, where we upload house-prices.csv)
    global data
    house_data = pd.read_csv(data + "house-prices.csv")

    # Now we subset the data based on the dropdown value
    # We replace the value we chose earlier (2) with bedroom_number_selected
    df_bedroom = house_data[house_data["bedrooms"] == bedroom_number_selected] 

    # Because the number of garage in the data is continuous, we convert it to discreet
    # for the plot
    df_bedroom["garage"] = df_bedroom["garage"].astype(str)

    # Create the scatter plot (with adjusted title)
    f = px.scatter(df_bedroom, x = "lotsize", y = "price", 
                   color = "garage",
                   title="House Prices vs Lot Size in the City of Windsor, Canada - " + str(bedroom_number_selected) + " bedroom(s)")

    # Change the axis labels
    f.update_layout(xaxis_title = "Lot Size (sqm)",
                    yaxis_title = "Price ($)")
    
    # Optional, we can add some additional configs to the plot. If not, just create an empty dictionary
    my_config = dict()

    # Now we only need to return this method moloewe_chart_plot
    return my_chart.moloewe_chart_plot(plotly_data = f.to_dict(), plotly_config = my_config)


# Append the function to class tool_graph
setattr(tool_graph, "get_houseprice_chart", get_houseprice_chart)
```

## **Testing the code directly in this IDE using MoLÃ¶we built-in function**

Here, we initialize the MoLÃ¶we project locally to test out the above functions directly in this IDE without having to upload the notebook onto MoLÃ¶we. This saves us time and effort, and ensures us catching all coding-related mistakes before running the notebook on the MoLÃ¶we server.

In the following cell, you only need to change the variable `local_path`. Remember to create all 5 asset folders - data, image, text, video, output - within this path as well, then put the `house_price.csv` file in `data` subfolder.

**IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE to comment out this entire section before saving the notebook and uploading it onto MoLÃ¶we**

```python
from moloewe_chart import MoloeweChart

def initialize_local_testing(local_data_path):

    project_data = {
            'folder_project_data': local_data_path + '/data/',
            'folder_project_image': local_data_path + '/image/',
            'folder_project_text': local_data_path + '/text/',
            'folder_project_video': local_data_path + '/video/',
            'folder_project_output': local_data_path + '/output/'
        }
    return project_data

# Load local path (you need to create all 5 asset folders - data, image, text, video, output - within this path as well, then put the .csv file in data) 

local_path = 'D:/codes/leuphana-work/molowe'

# project_data = initialize_local_testing('E:/projects/molowe') # Chan's laptop
project_data = initialize_local_testing(local_path) # Chan's workstation

# Initialize Moloewe() instance
local_testing = Moloewe().project_initialize(project_data)

# Initialize all testing objects
plot_test = MoloeweChart()
tool_map_test = tool_map()
tool_graph_test = tool_graph()
tool_switch_test = tool_switch()
tool_dropdown_test = tool_dropdown()
tool_slider_test = tool_slider()
```

Now you can check all the functions we wrote above. They show you all the possible values within the dropdown bedroom number, the currently selected value, and the corresponding plot with that value. You can go back and try selecting another bedroom number, then call the `moloewe_plot_preview` function to see the change in plot.

```python
# Check all values contained in the dropdown bedroom number
tool_dropdown_test.get_bedroom_number()
{'values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'default': 1}
```
```python
# Set desired bedroom number
tool_dropdown_test.set_bedroom_number(4)
```
```python
# Plot with selected bedroom number
plot_test.moloewe_plot_preview(tool_graph_test.get_houseprice_chart())
```

Hopefully, with this example, you could gain a better insight of the MoLÃ¶we logic. To sum up, interaction with MoLÃ¶we charts & maps can be done with the following steps:

- Come up with a concept of what you are trying to visualise (plot, map)
- Determine with part of that visualization would be your static part, and what would then be your "interactive" component
- Build the static part of the visualization
- Select any out of the possible values of the "interactive" component to be the placeholder
- Build this placeholder into the visualization to get a "skeleton version" of how the interactive visualization would look like, when a certain value from the interactive component is selected.
- Build `set` and `get` functions for the corresponding MoLÃ¶we interactive tool you would like to use (we have `tool_switch`, `tool_dropdown`, `tool_slider` for this)
- Build `get` function for the visualization (either with `tool_graph` or `tool_map`): combining the skeleton map and the selected value from the `set` function
