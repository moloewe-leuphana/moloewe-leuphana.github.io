# About This Tutorial

This Tutorial is an addition to the official **MoL√∂we booklet**, which you can request via email at 
**moloewe@leuphana.de**.

While the booklet acts as a project management guide, this tutorial will give you the **technical** instructions on how to
prepare a workshop in MoL√∂we.

To this end, we advise you to follow the [**MoL√∂we Workflow**](docs/workflow.md). It will guide you through this tutorial.

If you like to share your feedback or have ideas on how to improve this tutorial, please do not hesitate to 
contact us at the email address mentioned above.

Sincerely, <br />your MoL√∂we Team ü¶Å
