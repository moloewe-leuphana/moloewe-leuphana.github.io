# Local vs. Server-Presentation

There are two separate deployments (hereafter referred to as _versions_) of the Mobile Solution Workshop software:

1. the local version on the Mobile Solution Workshop Windows PC on campus
2. the server version on https://moloewe.leuphana.de/login

This is the same software in different locations. For each version a separate user account is needed. The local and server version differ in terms of accessibility and network settings.

The local version is only accessible from the local PC. A workshop presentation with the local version is advisable if users do not need and do not want to rely on internet access. The local version works in a local WI-FI network. All devices in the local WI-FI network (tablets, PC â€¦) can access the presentation.


The server version is accessible remotely. It requires internet access. If the workshop presentation relies on data that is not stored locally but instead online (e.g. large GIS data) the workshop should take place with the server version.

Mobile Solution Workshop projects can be exported and imported between the local and server version.

Users can work jointly (see user accounts) on the same Mobile Solution Workshop project on the server and the finished project could be exported and imported into the local version.
