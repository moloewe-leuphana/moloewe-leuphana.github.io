# User Account

User accounts are limited to researchers working on Mobile Solution Workshop projects and student courses at Leuphana
in the Mobile Solution Workshop. User accounts for workshop participants will be provided the day of the workshop session.
For researchers and students please send a request to  moloewe@leuphana.de and state your research project or course.
User privileges can be assigned to one or several Mobile Solution Workshop projects and modes. User privileges can be
given for the presentation mode (advisable for workshop participants) or edit mode.
Each project in the MoLöwe will have one User as the Owner/Author and will belong to one User-Group. These will be set
during the creation of a project and can be changed by the User-Group Administrator of that User-Group.
For each user account privileges may be given to certain functionalities in edit mode (e.g. import/export, creating new projects).
