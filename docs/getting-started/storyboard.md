# Storyboard

#### *Why do I need a storyboard?*
A storyboard will give you a visual representation of the **workshop design**, making it easier for you to
plan and understand the intended **user experience**, the **progression** of topics and which control elements
support this progression. A storyboard is also great to plan the **interplay** between screens and tablets.

#### *What do I put in a storyboard?*
A storyboard covers the **interactive processes** of your slides.


Take the different monitors and tablets as scenes of your storyboard.
Draw the shape of the monitors on paper and make a sketch within each monitor of the content.
Below each monitor write a short description of what happens in this specific “scene” and which tools
(control elements and content) are used. Storyboards will evolve during the preparation of the workshop,
from a broad sketch based on the first idea to a concrete list of Slides with Slide names and tools,
which can then be used to inform the workshop plan.

Here is an example of a storyboard template based on five big monitors and one tablet with two different slides.
