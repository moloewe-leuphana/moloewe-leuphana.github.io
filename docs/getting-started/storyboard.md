# Storyboard

Once you've defined your data input and output, it is time to start a **storyboard**.

#### *Why do I need a storyboard?*
With five monitors and five tablets, it is easy to lose track of your content.
A storyboard will give you a visual representation of the **workshop design**, making it easier for you to
plan and understand the intended **user experience**, the **progression** of topics and which control elements
support this progression. A storyboard is also great to plan the **interplay** between screens and tablets.

#### *What do I put in a storyboard?*
A storyboard includes information about your content, how you arrange it across the screens and the
**interactive processes** of your workshop.
In addition, it contains the respective slide names and [**tools**](glossary.md#tools) you want to use.

#### *But I haven't figured out all the content for my workshop yet...*
Don't worry, your storyboard will evolve during the preparation of your workshop.
You can start today with a broad sketch based on the ideas you have so far and add content with time.

**Here is an example of a storyboard:**

<iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVP1njcGM=/?moveToViewport=-1193,-476,3670,1835&embedId=280540072794" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen></iframe>

:::info
Certain properties like **slide names** and **tools** may have not been discussed yet.
We will discuss these in the course of this workflow after which you can update your screen overview.
