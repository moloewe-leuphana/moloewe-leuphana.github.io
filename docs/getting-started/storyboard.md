# Storyboard

Now that you have designed your screen overview, you have a solid foundation to work out the
**interactive components** of your workshop using a **storyboard**. 

Use hand-drawn storyboards to plan and visualise the content and interactions within the different monitors and tablets.
Storyboards can be of great help to plan out the overall user experience flow, including the progression of topics
and deciding which control elements support this progression. They can also be used to plan out the interplay of big
monitors and tablets.

Storyboards provide a visual representation of the workshop’s design, making it easier for the team members to
understand the intended user experience for workshop participants.

Take the different monitors and tablets as scenes of your storyboard.
Draw the shape of the monitors on paper and make a sketch within each monitor of the content.
Below each monitor write a short description of what happens in this specific “scene” and which tools
(control elements and content) are used. Storyboards will evolve during the preparation of the workshop,
from a broad sketch based on the first idea to a concrete list of Slides with Slide names and tools,
which can then be used to inform the workshop plan.

Here is an example of a storyboard template based on five big monitors and one tablet with two different slides.
As you can see, the storyboard is build on basis of the workshop plan. 

In addition to interaction processes, a storyboard also includes slide names and the 
[**tools**](glossary.md#tools) you want to use.

Certain properties like **slide names** and **tools** may have not been discussed yet.
We will discuss these in the course of this workflow after which you can update your screen overview.
