# Start your Workshop Plan

Once you've defined your workshop goal(s), it is time to start your workshop plan.
With five monitors, each having a respective tablet, it is easy to lose track of your content.
A workshop plan will help you define your content and how you arrange it.

A workshop plan includes an overview of all the [**slides**](glossary.md#slide) in your workshop,
with information about their content and other properties such as the respective slide names and the 
[**tools**](glossary.md#tools) you want to use.

:::info
Certain properties like **slide names** and **tools** have not been discussed yet.
We will discuss these in the course of this workflow after which you can update your workshop plan.
