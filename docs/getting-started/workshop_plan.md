# Workshop Plan

#### *Why do I need a workshop plan?*
With five monitors and five tablets, it is easy to lose track of your content.
A workshop plan will give you an overview of your slides, how you arrange them and how they interact
with each other.
This will make it easier for you to plan and develop your workshop.

#### *What do I put in a workshop plan?*
A workshop plan includes the content for each slide, the slide arrangements across the screens and
interactive processes between slides.
In addition, it contains the respective slide names.

**Here is an example of a workshop plan:**
