# MoLöwe Workflow

Preparing a workshop with the MoLöwe requires certain steps presented and explained in the following workflow.
We classify each step as either <MGMT>preparatory</MGMT> or <Tech>technical</Tech>.
Technical steps are broken down into one or more instructions listed in the sidebar to your left.

:::info Before you start
Before you jump into the steps, please familiarize yourself with the MoLöwe basics first by reading our <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/faq">**FAQ**</a> 
and checking out the information on our <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/">**main page**</a>.

## <Management> 1. Define your Workshop Goal(s) </Management>

Due to MoLöwes unique setup and wide range of capabilities, you can achieve a variety of goals with your workshop.
Please see section "Why MoLöwe?" on the <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/">**main page**</a> for
inspiration.
 
## <Management> 2. Create a Storyboard </Management>

Once you've defined your workshop goal, it is time to create a storyboard.
With five monitors, each having a respective tablet, it is easy to lose track of your content.
A storyboard will help you plan your content and how you arrange it.

A storyboard includes an overview of all the [**slides**](docs/06_glossary.md#slide) in your workshop, 
arranged by their chronological order. Try to be as detailed as possible.

:::info
We especially advise you to add the respective [**slide names**](docs/03-the-interface/05_slides.md#2-editing-slide-details) in your storyboard.
This will make switching between slides much easier later on using the see [**Change Scene Button**](docs/04-moloewe-tools/11_change-scene.md).
However, at this point of the tutorial you haven't created or named any slides yet. You can add the slide names to your
storyboard later.

**Here's an example of a simple storyboard:**
