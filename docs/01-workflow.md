# MoLöwe Workflow

Preparing a workshop with the MoLöwe requires certain steps presented and explained in the following workflow.
Each step is classified as either <Tech>technical</Tech> or <MGMT>project management</MGMT>.
Technical steps are broken down into one or more instructions listed in the sidebar to your left.

:::info Before you start

## <Management> 1. Define your Workshop Goal </Management>

Due to its unique setup and wide range of capabilities, your workshop can achieve a variety of goals with the MoLöwe.
The goals are already covered in the "Why MoLöwe" section of the <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/">**main page**</a>.
 
## <Management> 2. Create a Storyboard </Management>

Once you've defined your workshop goal, it is time to create a storyboard.
With five monitors, each having a respective tablet, it is easy to lose track of your content.
A storyboard will help you plan your content and how you arrange it.

A storyboard includes an overview of all the pages in your workshop, arranged by their chronological order.
Try to be as detailed as possible: add descriptions, images, the presenting person (if you're presenting in a team) and
on which monitor or tablet the respective page will be displayed on.

**Here's a storyboard example:**
