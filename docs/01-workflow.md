# MoLöwe Workflow

Preparing a workshop with the MoLöwe requires certain steps presented and explained in the following workflow.

/* We classify each step as either preparatory or technical.
Technical steps are broken down into one or more instructions listed in the sidebar to your left.*/

:::info Before you start
Before you jump into the steps, please familiarize yourself with the MoLöwe basics first by reading our <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/faq">**FAQ**</a> 
and checking out the information on our <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/">**main page**</a>.

## <Highlight> 1. Define your Workshop Goal(s) </Highlight>

Due to MoLöwes unique setup and wide range of capabilities, you can achieve a variety of goals with your workshop.
Please see section "Why MoLöwe?" on the <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/">**main page**</a> for
inspiration.
 
## <Highlight> 2. Create a Storyboard </Highlight>

Once you've defined your workshop goal, it is time to create a storyboard.
With five monitors, each having a respective tablet, it is easy to lose track of your content.
A storyboard will help you plan your content and how you arrange it.

A storyboard includes an overview of all the [**slides**](docs/06_glossary.md#slide) in your workshop, 
arranged by their chronological order. Try to be as detailed as possible.

:::info
We especially advise you to add the respective [**slide names**](docs/03-the-interface/05_slides.md#2-editing-slide-details) in your storyboard.
This will make switching between slides much easier later on using the see [**Change Scene Button**](docs/04-moloewe-tools/11_change-scene.md).
However, at this point of the tutorial you haven't created or named any slides yet. You can add the slide names to your
storyboard later.

**Here's an example of a simple storyboard:**

You are free to use this example as your template. Please contact the MoLöwe team if you're interested.

## <Highlight> 3. Request a User Account </Highlight>

You're going to build your MoLöwe project in the **MoLöwe software** (browser based i.e. no local installation needed),
which you can use remotely from your office, home, anywhere.
Accessing the MoLöwe software requires a user account (name and password).

User accounts are limited to researchers and student courses at Leuphana.
Please send a request for a user account to **moloewe@leuphana.de** and state your research project or course.
User accounts for workshop participants will be provided the day of the workshop session.

Once you received your username and password, you can access the MoLöwe software [**here**](https://moloewe.leuphana.de/login).

:::info Working at the MoLöwe campus site 
You will also receive a second user account for the MoLöwe campus site.
For information on how to use MoLöwe on campus, see chapters "Local vs. Server version" and "Working on Campus" of the MoLöwe Booklet.

## <Highlight> 4. Getting Started </Highlight>

After you logged in, you will be directed to the **Selection Page** where you can select a **mode**.
Please familiarize yourself with modes by reading the [**Selection Page chapter**](docs/02-getting-started/01_selection_page.md).

## <Highlight> 5. Create a new Project </Highlight>

**About User privileges**

User privileges can be assigned to one or several MoLöwe projects and modes. User privileges can be given for presentation mode 
(advisable for workshop participants) or edit mode.<br />
Each MoLöwe project will belong to one user group and have one user as the owner/author.
The user group will be set during the creation of a project and can be changed by the user group administrator.
For each user account privileges may be given to certain functionalities in edit mode (e.g. import/export, creating new projects).
- "MoLöwe" is short for "Mobile Lösungswerkstatt" (eng. "Mobile Solution Workshop")
- see [Glossary](06_glossary.md)
- Software to create and run interactive browser based dashboard.
- Based on open standard frameworks (_plotly, Echarts, mapbox_).
- With control elements for interactive data visualisation (button, switch, dropdown, slider).
- User programs interactive content and tools in _jupyter notebook_ ( _Python_ language).
- Content that is not interactive (video, image, slideshow, textbox) can be added via the MoLöwe Software directly (not programmed in  _jupyter notebook_ ).
- Users upload their _jupyter notebook_ based on the jupyter notebook template for their project.
- Users upload files, like images, videos, text and data for their project.
- MoLöwe Software runs with any browser, but use Mozilla Firefox for optimal results.
- The MoLöwe Software runs on the moloewe.leuphana.de server (remote access), as well as on the local machine at Leuphana.
- The MoLöwe application on the server and the local machine are two separate systems with separate user account management.
- To get started (see Getting Started) you need a user account. 
- The local machine is connected to five 65’’ screens, which is the basic set-up for a workshop setting.
- The five 65’’ screens offer workshop participants an immersive experience.
- Workshop participants can interact with the content on the big screens via tablets.
- The following documentation will guide you through the application step by step.
