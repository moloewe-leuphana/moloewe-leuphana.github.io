# MoLöwe Workflow

Preparing a workshop with the MoLöwe requires certain **steps** presented and explained in the following workflow.

:::info Before you start
Before you jump into the steps, please familiarize yourself with the MoLöwe basics first by reading our <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/faq">**FAQ**</a> 
and checking out the information on our <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/">**main page**</a>.

## <Highlight> 1 Request a User Account </Highlight>

You're going to build your MoLöwe project in the **MoLöwe software** (browser based i.e. no local installation needed),
which you can use remotely from your office, home, anywhere.
Accessing the MoLöwe software requires a user account (name and password).

User accounts are limited to researchers and student courses at Leuphana.
Please send a request for a user account to **moloewe@leuphana.de** and state your research project or course.
User accounts for workshop participants will be provided the day of the workshop session.

You will also receive a user account for the MoLöwe campus site.
For information on how to use MoLöwe on campus, see chapters "Local vs. Server version" and "Working on Campus" of the MoLöwe Booklet.

:::info While you wait for your user account, please continue with the following two chapters.

## Define your Workshop Goal(s)

Due to MoLöwes unique setup and wide range of capabilities, you can achieve a variety of goals with your workshop.
It is important to define your workshop goal(s) before starting a project.
Please see section "Why MoLöwe?" on the <a href="https://moloewe-leuphana.github.io/">**main page**</a> for
inspiration.
 
## Start a Storyboard

Once you've defined your workshop goal(s), it is time to start a storyboard.
With five monitors, each having a respective tablet, it is easy to lose track of your content.
A storyboard will help you plan your content and how you arrange it.

A storyboard includes an overview of all the [**slides**](06_glossary.md#slide) in your workshop,
with information about their content and other properties such as the respective slide names and the [**tools**](06_glossary.md#tools) you want to use.

:::info
Certain properties like **slide names** and **tools** have not been discussed yet.
We will discuss these properties in the course of this workflow after which you can update your storyboard.

**Here's an example of a storyboard:**

You are free to use this example as your template. Please contact the MoLöwe team if you're interested.

**About User privileges**

User privileges can be assigned to one or several MoLöwe projects and modes. User privileges can be given for Presentation Mode 
(advisable for workshop participants) or Edit Mode.<br />
Each MoLöwe project will belong to one user group and have one user as the owner/author.
The user group will be set during the creation of a project and can be changed by the user group administrator.
For each user account privileges may be given to certain functionalities in Edit Mode (e.g. import/export, creating new projects).
- "MoLöwe" is short for "Mobile Lösungswerkstatt" (eng. "Mobile Solution Workshop")
- see [Glossary](06_glossary.md)
- Software to create and run interactive browser based dashboard.
- Based on open standard frameworks (_plotly, Echarts, mapbox_).
- With control elements for interactive data visualisation (button, switch, dropdown, slider).
- User programs interactive content and tools in _jupyter notebook_ ( _Python_ language).
- Content that is not interactive (video, image, slideshow, textbox) can be added via the MoLöwe Software directly (not programmed in  _jupyter notebook_ ).
- Users upload their _jupyter notebook_ based on the jupyter notebook template for their project.
- Users upload files, like images, videos, text and data for their project.
- MoLöwe Software runs with any browser, but use Mozilla Firefox for optimal results.
- The MoLöwe Software runs on the moloewe.leuphana.de server (remote access), as well as on the local machine at Leuphana.
- The MoLöwe application on the server and the local machine are two separate systems with separate user account management.
- To get started (see Getting Started) you need a user account. 
- The local machine is connected to five 65’’ screens, which is the basic set-up for a workshop setting.
- The five 65’’ screens offer workshop participants an immersive experience.
- Workshop participants can interact with the content on the big screens via tablets.
- The following documentation will guide you through the application step by step.
