# Projects

Once you have logged in to MoLöwe you will see a list of projects that you have access to (see below). This page is called Projects page and it allows users to select a project and start working on it, or create a new project, or import a MoLöwe project that was exported earlier.

In this section, all the functionality of the Projects page are discussed.

From the list of projects, identify the name of the project whose details need to be changed. In this example, we want to change the details of a project named "Font + Line Width Tests". 

Then click on an icon with an "i" on the right side of the project name (next to the pencil icon).

From this page, the following details of the project can be changed:

* Project Name
* Description
* Author Name
* Project Status

Once the changes have been made, you can save the changes by pressing on the "Save" button on the right side of the page.

This page also allows users to delete or export the project by clicking on respective buttons.

##  **3 Selecting a Project** 

A project can be selected by clicking on the name of the project. 

Alternatively, one can also press on the pencil icon to the right of the project name to select a project. When a project is selected, the details of the project are shown to the user (see below). 

(In this example, a project named "Font + Line Width Test" was selected.)
