# Front-End

The *front-end* of MoLöwe refers to all the pages that you see when you visit MoLöwe on your web browser. 

The front-end allows users to access, create, and edit projects. Further, provided that a user has Project Edit rights, the front-end also allows her to upload new MoLöwe notebooks, upload files, and setup slides and screens. Finally if a user has presentation access rights, the font-end also allows users to start or view interactive presentations from different projects.

Users are assigned the required access rights by the administrator of MoLöwe.

The pages that constitute the front-end are described in this section.

## **1 Login Page**

Login page is where you log in to the MoLöwe system via your web browser.

If you are using MoLöwe for the first time, this will be the first page that you encounter. This is also the page that you will see when you visit MoLöwe when you have not logged in yet.

:::caution

The user account and password protection feature in MoLöwe should not be considered a secured access and data stored there to be safe from unauthorized access and deletion. The user account system in MoLöwe is primarily in place to organize the access to different functions of it.
