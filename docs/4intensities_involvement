Information: 
Participants choose a location and scenario for increasing green infrastructure and learn through interactive graphs and
images about the costs and benefits.

Consultation:
City planners and residents give their feedback on the suggested scenario to replace parking spots with green areas. 

Collaboration:
City planners suggest an adjusted scenario, which includes a park and ride area to compensate for the lost parking spots
and to include green traffic islands for traffic management.

Empowerment 
For the second workshop session scientist have incorporated input from residents and city planners to visualise the
planned green spaces for a concrete neighbourhood. Participants leave the workshop with a list of steps and time table
towards implementation, images of the planned green infrastructure and responsibilities to put plans into action are clear.
